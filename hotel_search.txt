The latter can be best felt in the large range of health club facilities that the venue can offer. Guests can relax with a visit to the sauna, treat themselves to a Turkish bath or swim in the large outdoor pool. They can also have their pick between the 2 chilled water baths and the chilled water pool. There is a concrete tennis court, which can be used for some friendly competition. The little guests will have their own children's park, where they can let the steam off and have some fun. ",
